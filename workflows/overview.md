# Workflow overview

## Workflows in scope
1. Member feedback collection (Forms → SharePoint → notification)
2. Volunteer sign-up and task routing
3. Event RSVP and reminders
4. Simple internal approvals (e.g., comms sign-off)

## Principles
- Keep forms minimal (only collect what is needed)
- Store responses in structured lists (SharePoint List)
- Automate routing/notifications (Power Automate)
- Use least-privilege access for editors/admins
